Western Markets Disconnect
The western energy markets are currently in a pricing
crisis. Power supply shortages and threats of system
blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California, and
spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy
headache for the West. Gas prices along the Pacific
corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the
South have jumped to over $40.00 per MMBtu during
December after averaging over $15.00 per MMBtu through
the second half of November. Extreme weather, strong
power demand for gas, and unusually low gas storage
levels have combined to intensify the demand for
pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity
bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor.
The result is prices that dramatically ""disconnected""
from the rest of the North American gas market in a way
that is more typical of Northeast markets during the
winter.

The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as
the demand drivers combined with weakened storage
inventories will maintain price pressure on western
price points throughout the winter. However, the recent
jumps in western gas market differentials-to more than a
$10 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub-should ease
somewhat with a break in the weather. Under any weather
scenario, spikes up into the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu
range will be a feature of winter markets along the West
Coast. On balance, we expect West Coast price
differentials to average at a $4.00-$8.00 per MMBtu
premium through winter. The spring hydroelectric runoff
season should offer the first opportunity for a break in
differentials that could drop back to more typical
levels of less than $1.00 per MMBtu.

Over the long term, increased pipeline capacity and
additional gas supply are needed to break the
vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes.
However, significant new capacity additions are still 12
to 24 months away. In the meantime-particularly this
winter-sustained high and volatile price differentials
and extremely high absolute prices at western points are
likely to draw the increased attention of state
regulators and the FERC, as winter heating demand
exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the
crisis.

Building Up to the Price Spike
The first signs of natural gas price spikes and
disconnects emerged this summer, as sharp year-over-year
increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to
new highs. As pipeline capacity constraints into
California became evident, differentials in Southern
California moved up to a $1.00 per MMBtu premium to the
Henry Hub. These extremely high prices, as well as low
forward spreads, discouraged storage injections through
the summer. As a result, a strong storage position early
in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through
July. In August a lateral on El Paso's southern system
exploded; the accident further limited pipeline capacity
into California for a two-week period. During that time,
the market drew heavily on storage inventories and
further weakened storage positions. As hydroelectric
generation declined through the summer, the price
strength extended into Northern California. Malin, which
had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the
summer, began trading at a $0.50 per MMBtu premium to
the Henry Hub in September. The summer and early fall
market set the stage for continued and more intense
spikes this winter. The following factors are now
driving this market:

* Continuing surges in gas demand. Gas demand levels
have remained high since early summer, driven by higher
overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric
output. Demand levels for the third quarter in the US
West averaged 10.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, up
from 8.7 Bcf per day during the third quarter 1999.
Persistently strong gas-fired generation production
through the fall months diverted gas to power
production, frustrating efforts to fill storage. This
pressure will continue. The year-over-year demand
increases from the power sector will be compounded, as
evidenced in November, by swings upward in residential
and commercial heating demand of 800 million cubic feet
(MMcf) per day. Overall, CERA expects nearly 1.6 Bcf per
day of increased demand in the West this winter, with
the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions
showing 1.2 Bcf per day of increased demand. Key power
sector drivers, including the strong economy, colder
weather, and lower hydroelectric generation, will
continue to push gas-fired generation.

* Pipeline utilization nears capacity. Strong western
demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western
pipes to high levels. Flows from British Columbia into
the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels
since summer, while flows from the Rockies on Northwest
have remained at pipeline capacity. Flows on PGT into
Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity, although
approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess capacity exists
on PGT into California at Malin. Likewise, flows out of
the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently
remained at capacity. The only slack pipeline capacity
remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on
Southwest pipes. During the past few months, these
pipelines have operated at their highest utilization
rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early
last decade. The high utilization of western pipeline
capacity-reminiscent of power plant capacity constraints
that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the
West this summer-leaves very little slack capacity to
provide a relief valve for demand spikes. And that is
exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks
(see Figure 1). Given the level of storage inventories
and expected gas demand, flows on the El Paso and
Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher
flow levels from December through March than they have
averaged through November.

* Deteriorating storage position. At the start of
November California storage inventories held at 154 Bcf,
a full 32 Bcf below the five-year average inventory
level. The strong in-state withdrawals during November
weakened that position to 128 Bcf; the deficit swelled
to 62 Bcf. Inventories in California have never fallen
below 60 Bcf, so deliverability through the end of
winter is likely less than 700 MMcf per day. Storage
inventories in California are so low that utilities'
ability to balance withdrawals from storage with
purchases from demand-sensitive price points is severely
limited. If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid-
December materializes, this effort at balance will be
even further compromised for the remainder of winter
(see Figure 2).

* Short-term contracting. A significant amount of
western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market.
A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline
capacity to spot transactions-in many cases in response
to gas and power industry deregulation-has left the West
much more exposed to spot market volatility. In other
areas of the country, utilities have significant firm
pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the
citygate and/or have forward purchased gas (at previous
and lower prices) for at least some portion of their
winter supplies. As a result, unlike in eastern markets,
a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of
California utilities will be exposed to the current
price spikes.

* No alternatives. A lack of fuel-switching capability
prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas
prices. Power prices continue to move in lockstep with
the increase in gas prices. Not surprisingly, gas prices
pushed the cost of gas-fired generation beyond the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) proposed
price cap of $150 per megawatt-hour, setting the stage
for a reassessment of this price limit. A small and
declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel
capable. Significantly, air emissions restrictions-
already plaguing power markets with much higher
emissions credit costs this year-will make any further
switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California
market highly unlikely this winter. A recent meeting of
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which
has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area, concluded
with no relief granted to generators running short of
emissions credits.

Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November
The first cold weather-related demand spike demonstrated
the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability
of the western markets. A cold weather system in mid-
November brought temperatures averaging 47 percent
colder than normal-the temperatures actually averaged 14
percent colder than a normal January week-and provided
the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery
systems on the West Coast. Capacity constraints on
moving gas into California that appeared during the
summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as
heating loads climbed. This core demand compounded the
effects of continued strong demand for gas for power
generation.

The high power demand was the result of the intersection
of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and
a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power
plant outages. Gas demand in the US West during the last
two weeks of November was boosted to approximately 15.5
Bcf per day, driven by heating demand increases of 2.8
Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage-
related demand increases of 1.0 Bcf per day.

These demand spikes caused buyers-already dependent on
the spot market-to bid citygate prices to record high
levels through the last two weeks of November and into
December. Since demand outstripped supply, prices rose
dramatically at all western price points, and flows of
natural gas to western markets increased over high
summer levels. Citygate prices surged beyond $40.00 per
MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly $15.00
per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock. Daily spot gas
prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many
western market regions.

West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter
Although the week of November 13 could prove to be the
peak demand week in the West this winter, CERA does not
expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West
Coast any time soon. Storage inventories are so low that
the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage
withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities.
Generators, which already rely heavily on the spot
market for supplies, are faced with a bidding war for
scarce supplies. Colder-than-normal weather would likely
keep West Coast prices in the $20.00-$40.00 per MMBtu
range. More normal weather would allow a slow decline
from current levels of over $20.00 per MMBtu down into
the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu range. However, the storage
situation and underlying demand strength mean that any
return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early
January.

This winter will prove a critical test for western gas
markets, and the end of the heating season will likely
provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in
the West Coast market. As heating loads diminish
significantly in March and storage deliverability is no
longer a critical issue, premiums should retreat back
into the $1.00-$2.00 per MMBtu range. As hydroelectric
generation begins to increase, the pressure could
subside even further, but storage injections during the
spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines
even during the spring.

The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest
The West Coast price pressure is not limited to
California. High demand in the Pacific Northwest (and
more indirectly in California) will keep upward pressure
on prices from Sumas to Stanfield. Northwest pipeline
capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at
the onset of the cold weather and even so can only
provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest. The
combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed
Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are
bidirectional there. The only supply source for the load
centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in
northern Pacific Northwest (such as Seattle) are from
Westcoast at Sumas. The Westcoast mainline from the
producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also
been operating at capacity. The same bidding forces felt
in California have been evident at these western
Canadian price points, pushing Sumas prices into the
$20s per MMBtu. These forces will persist, keeping Sumas
at a premium to AECO over the winter-and in much closer
relationship to California prices.

Customer Response:  Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire
With power plants and gas utilities paying the current
high spot prices, consumers' bills from Vancouver to San
Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity
prices. The gas industry has been preparing for rate
shock this winter, warning regulators and customers
alike. However, the price spikes in the West and the
sustained premiums in western markets move beyond
alarming. Capacity holders are reaping significant
rewards for their investments in capacity positions,
resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from
consumers to capacity holders. Market power and market
gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will
find easy application in their gas market counterpart
(no matter what their merits). Some level of
investigation into the natural gas markets during or
following this challenging winter should be expected. As
has occurred in the power markets, this will now turn
attention to gas purchasing practices, particularly in
California. The likely outcome of this process will be a
shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases
toward a more flexible portfolio approach.

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint 
""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998."" 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. ""No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time.""

much for your perspective. The main reason why I questioned the 'real' deat=
h of Dawes at the end of the book was my initial inability to reconcile whe=
re Book/Chapter 3.1 (Dawes' first scenes with Urzika) took place in time. I=
t was unclear to me where the Urzika thread picked up after his period of i=
nstitutionalization and scene on the Mexican train. I have since re-read Bo=
ok 3 and realize that section 3.5 picks up where 3.1 left off and Dawes tim=
e with Urzika is chronological. So, I now agree with your assessment of Daw=
es' death being real, though I am a little curious as to the physical cause=
 of it - alcohol poisoning or complications from his infected eye or some o=
f both. Congratulations for discovering this book back when it was publishe=

much for your perspective. The main reason why I questioned the 'real' deat=
h of Dawes at the end of the book was my initial inability to reconcile whe=
re Book/Chapter 3.1 (Dawes' first scenes with Urzika) took place in time. I=
t was unclear to me where the Urzika thread picked up after his period of i=
nstitutionalization and scene on the Mexican train. I have since re-read Bo=
ok 3 and realize that section 3.5 picks up where 3.1 left off and Dawes tim=
e with Urzika is chronological. So, I now agree with your assessment of Daw=
es' death being real, though I am a little curious as to the physical cause=
 of it - alcohol poisoning or complications from his infected eye or some o=
f both. Congratulations for discovering this book back when it was publishe=
d. Please let me know if you have any new perspectives to share after you r=

PG&E to Expand Pacific Northwest System

Responding to tight energy supplies in the Pacific Northwest and California, 
PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group revealed plans Wednesday to begin an open 
season early next year, kicking off a five-year expansion effort. The first 
phase would add 200 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity out of western 
Canada on its Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) pipeline system. The PG&E GTN 
group expects the phase one expansion to be in service by November 2002 at 
the latest. 

""As we have been anticipating, the western natural gas market is at a 
critical point in the need for additional pipeline capacity,"" said Thomas B. 
King, president of the PG&E National Energy Group (PG&E NEG) West Region. 
""Gas supplies into the Pacific Northwest and California are very tight. At 
the same time, the market is strong and growing, and the PG&E Gas 
Transmission Northwest pipeline system has been operating at or near maximum 
capacity levels for the greater part of the year. We believe GTN is now 
positioned for an aggressive expansion period that will result in additional 
supplies of natural gas --- at competitive transportation rates --- in this 
region for both direct-use customers and electric generation by 2002."" 

King noted that the phase one expansion of the GTN system was brought on 
primarily because of the state of disarray in the California market. He cited 
the growing use of gas to fuel electric generating facilities as the main 
reason new capacity is needed. 

King added that the GTN pipeline system is the most direct and economic link 
for tapping the Canadian production basins, and bringing the load to 
California and the Pacific Northwest markets. He also emphasized that the 
expansions would help the market prepare for new supply from Alaska. 

""We are constantly talking to our customers about what is the right time for 
us to expand our pipeline system,"" said Sandra McDonough, spokeswoman for 
PG&E Corp. ""With the power plant development both in California and in the 
Pacific Northwest, including plants in the Northwest that are being built 
right next to our pipeline, the time is clearly now to start expanding the 
system. We have gotten more bids for capacity than we have been able to move 
recently."" McDonough told Daily GPI last week that the company was looking to 
expand its mainline in the near future (see Daily GPI, Dec. 13). 

To gauge demand, PG&E NEG plans to launch an open season for the 200 MMcf/d 
expansion of the mainline beginning on Jan. 2, 2001. Bids are due by Feb. 15, 
2001. Following the open season, the company will hold a capacity 
rationalization period, which will allow existing shippers to release 
capacity directly to customers who have expressed an interest. 

The 612-mile dual pipe GTN system begins at the Idaho-British Columbia 
border, travels through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central 
Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon-California border where it connects with 
the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. intrastate pipeline system. 

Currently, the GTN system is the largest U.S. transporter of Canadian natural 
gas with 2.7 Bcf/d of capacity. The expansion was deemed necessary because 
the average contract term on the line extends through 2013, and the pipeline 
has been operating at capacity, or near capacity for most of 2000. The method 
of expansion had not been decided on yet, but it is expected to include 
additional compression and some looping. 

McDonough said PG&E has been in contact with its upstream providers including 
TransCanada Pipelines Limited (TCPL) to ensure coordination of capacity. Doug 
Baldwin, CEO of TCPL, said TransCanada will work with PG&E NEG to examine 
and, if appropriate, satisfy the needs of market participants in both the 
western United States and Canada. 

If response to the open season is adequate, PG&E NEG hopes to move along with 
the project immediately. The November 2002 in service date includes an 
anticipated one-year process to obtain a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC) permit. 

""We also expect to have an incremental 265 MMcf/d of new direct-connect 
gas-fired electric generation load along the GTN system in the Pacific 
Northwest by mid-2002,"" King said. ""We expect to follow the 2002 project 
immediately with additional pipeline expansions to meet the need for 
additional gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest, on both the east and west 
sides of the Cascade Mountains."" 

For the next five-to-eight years, PG&E Corp. expects to be busy with pipeline 
expansions and new additions. The company has planned a second mainline 
expansion to be in service in 2004, with a new interconnect near Spokane, WA, 
which will serve the Puget Sound/Seattle area. The last expansion phase will 
be brought online sometime after 2005. With Alaskan gas fields expected to be 
ready for commercial service in the next five to 10 years, PG&E NEG will 
build an expansion that will facilitate transportation of gas from Alaska and 
Canada's Northwest Territories to markets in the lower 48 states. 

""Overall what we are looking at is the potential to expand the system by 1 
Bcf/d over the next decade,"" McDonough said.

Nevada Goes for the Gold

By Dave Todd 
dtodd@ftenergy.com <mailto:dtodd@ftenergy.com> 

It's a reverse twist on America's economic history. One might even call it a 
case of Eastward Ho!

For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part 
of the United States, entrepreneurs are talking about leaving, not moving 
into, the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business 
to the east. Not much farther east, only over the mountains into neighboring 
states, but still in that direction, as opposed to jurisdictions north or 
south of California. And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular 
industry are emanating from Nevada. 

Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology 
Association, recently warned that massive power price increases and future 
rate hikes ""could be the genesis for industry departures from the state."" The 
impact on large industrial users, he warned, could ""provide an impetus for a 
statewide economic downturn"" in California, which accounts for about 12% of 
the United States GDP.

California's mass exodus
Since the beginning of the year, Nevada's primary economic development 
agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate 
some or all of their operations to the state. The bad news for California is 
that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or ""wannabes"" whose 
growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the 
dependability of future electric supply delivery.

Somer Hollingsworth, president and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority in 
Las Vegas, said in late January he was urgently asked to meet with corporate 
officials of a major California company to brief them about relocating to 
Nevada. In meeting with the company he asked, ""Are there others like you? And 
they said, yes, we can introduce you to company after company after company."" 

Overwhelmingly, it is high-tech California companies that are most interested 
in moving because of their ever-growing requirements for reliability in their 
electric service. Beyond that, ""We have five power companies that have 
already come down here and talked to us-power producers,"" he said. These 
companies, including Calpine Corp., are keen to take advantage of a variety 
of opportunities made easier by the fact that, unlike California, Nevada has 
no state income tax and no general corporate or business inventory tax, 
putting it at both a geographical proximity and tax advantage to California. 
It also puts Nevada ahead of other low-tax Western states such as Arizona, 
Colorado and Utah. 

Reno/Silicon Valley share symbiotic relationship
Hollingsworth's northern counterpart at Reno's public/private sector-backed 
agency, the Economic Development Association of Western Nevada (EDAWN), tells 
a similar story. Chuck Alvey, who heads that body, says interest in his city 
from Silicon Valley refugees is becoming intense. 

A mere three-hours' drive and 40-minute plane ride from the San Francisco/San 
Jose area, Reno and Lake Tahoe already house hundreds of high-tech industry 
executives who commute back and forth and who have, up to now, escaped the 
impact of power drains caused by their energy-intensive industries. ""Server 
farms,"" banks of computers that manage Web sites and related business 
operations, continue to grow in number. A single server farm can require as 
much as 10 MW of power to operate.

Strict new federal energy efficiency standards, to curb demand by other power 
hogs, such as residential central air conditioners and heat pumps, clothes 
washers, water heaters and commercial heating and cooling equipment, won't be 
implemented in time to affect the current power crisis. The U.S. Department 
of Energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could 
save consumers and businesses more than $19 billion over the next 30 years. 

Though the energy saved would eliminate the need for 40,000 MW of new power 
generation, the new standards wouldn't be phased in until between 2003 and 
2007. 

Stan Thomas, director of business planning and growth strategies for Sierra 
Pacific Power Co., Nevada's dominant energy company, said his business has 
""experienced great success"" at moving Silicon Valley-based firms' divisions 
into Nevada, albeit in a limited way. ""But we're seeing a lot more companies 
saying: 'Wait a minute. We can't operate here anymore with power being shut 
off, and having payrolls to meet and not producing any product.' "" 

He added that getting ""a little more aggressive"" about enticing electricity 
supply-constrained companies to relocate to Nevada is no longer likely to be 
seen as a cherry-picking operation at another state's expense. In fact, 
Nevada froze its electric deregulation planning last year, pausing to 
reconsider its options, as a direct result of California's policy confusion. 
""We have delayed until we have a plan together where capacity exceeds (native 
in-state) demand,"" said Thomas. 

Sierra Pacific's power delivery capabilities are being enhanced by its plan 
to build a new 345-kV line in eastern Nevada to import power from Utah. In 
1998, it also installed a major line into the Pacific Northwest. Both 
developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to 
become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator. 

""We're learning our lesson here,"" said Thomas. Setting aside the issue of 
burgeoning energy demand requirements across the West, the need to recover 
stranded costs associated with deregulation is a preoccupation for power 
plant-owners in general, he said. 

As for California, "" I think the next couple of years are going to be some 
tight times, no doubt about it. And that's why what we're trying to do (in 
Nevada) is secure long-term contracts as well as short-term contracts to 
protect our customers while we're in the process of securing capacity, to 
ensure that we have an adequate supply of electricity at reasonable rates."" 

Other areas targeting California companies
It's not just Nevada's physical proximity to California that helps it attract 
relocating companies. It's also the different opportunities offered by 
Nevada's two main population centers, Reno and Las Vegas. Both cities attract 
different kinds of energy-dependent businesses from California. In this 
regard, ""We are two different markets,"" said Thomas.

In any case, Nevada isn't the only state that's getting calls, and returning 
interest in kind. Half a continent away, Tennessee's state department of 
economic and community development recently targeted about 1,000 California 
companies with financial enticements and advertisements that proclaim ""the 
lights are always on"" in the electric power-rich Tennessee Valley Authority's 
service territory. Elsewhere across the nation, from Seattle to Manhattan, 
there are initiatives to build or refurbish buildings to make them capable of 
servicing high-energy demand, Internet-related data centers. 

Nevada, however, has one giant advantage, aside from being closer to 
California. Las Vegas, for example, has one of the most extensive, readily 
accessible black fiber systems of any major metropolitan area in the United 
States. But of course it would. As the Nevada Development Authority's 
Hollingsworth joked: ""Most everything we have here is state-of-the-art and

Nevada Goes for the Gold

By Dave Todd 
dtodd@ftenergy.com <mailto:dtodd@ftenergy.com> 

It's a reverse twist on America's economic history. One might even call it a 
case of Eastward Ho!

For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part 
of the United States, entrepreneurs are talking about leaving, not moving 
into, the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business 
to the east. Not much farther east, only over the mountains into neighboring 
states, but still in that direction, as opposed to jurisdictions north or 
south of California. And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular 
industry are emanating from Nevada. 

Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology 
Association, recently warned that massive power price increases and future 
rate hikes ""could be the genesis for industry departures from the state."" The 
impact on large industrial users, he warned, could ""provide an impetus for a 
statewide economic downturn"" in California, which accounts for about 12% of 
the United States GDP.

California's mass exodus
Since the beginning of the year, Nevada's primary economic development 
agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate 
some or all of their operations to the state. The bad news for California is 
that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or ""wannabes"" whose 
growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the 
dependability of future electric supply delivery.

Somer Hollingsworth, president and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority in 
Las Vegas, said in late January he was urgently asked to meet with corporate 
officials of a major California company to brief them about relocating to 
Nevada. In meeting with the company he asked, ""Are there others like you? And 
they said, yes, we can introduce you to company after company after company."" 

Overwhelmingly, it is high-tech California companies that are most interested 
in moving because of their ever-growing requirements for reliability in their 
electric service. Beyond that, ""We have five power companies that have 
already come down here and talked to us-power producers,"" he said. These 
companies, including Calpine Corp., are keen to take advantage of a variety 
of opportunities made easier by the fact that, unlike California, Nevada has 
no state income tax and no general corporate or business inventory tax, 
putting it at both a geographical proximity and tax advantage to California. 
It also puts Nevada ahead of other low-tax Western states such as Arizona, 
Colorado and Utah. 

Reno/Silicon Valley share symbiotic relationship
Hollingsworth's northern counterpart at Reno's public/private sector-backed 
agency, the Economic Development Association of Western Nevada (EDAWN), tells 
a similar story. Chuck Alvey, who heads that body, says interest in his city 
from Silicon Valley refugees is becoming intense. 

A mere three-hours' drive and 40-minute plane ride from the San Francisco/San 
Jose area, Reno and Lake Tahoe already house hundreds of high-tech industry 
executives who commute back and forth and who have, up to now, escaped the 
impact of power drains caused by their energy-intensive industries. ""Server 
farms,"" banks of computers that manage Web sites and related business 
operations, continue to grow in number. A single server farm can require as 
much as 10 MW of power to operate.

Strict new federal energy efficiency standards, to curb demand by other power 
hogs, such as residential central air conditioners and heat pumps, clothes 
washers, water heaters and commercial heating and cooling equipment, won't be 
implemented in time to affect the current power crisis. The U.S. Department 
of Energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could 
save consumers and businesses more than $19 billion over the next 30 years. 

Though the energy saved would eliminate the need for 40,000 MW of new power 
generation, the new standards wouldn't be phased in until between 2003 and 
2007. 

Stan Thomas, director of business planning and growth strategies for Sierra 
Pacific Power Co., Nevada's dominant energy company, said his business has 
""experienced great success"" at moving Silicon Valley-based firms' divisions 
into Nevada, albeit in a limited way. ""But we're seeing a lot more companies 
saying: 'Wait a minute. We can't operate here anymore with power being shut 
off, and having payrolls to meet and not producing any product.' "" 

He added that getting ""a little more aggressive"" about enticing electricity 
supply-constrained companies to relocate to Nevada is no longer likely to be 
seen as a cherry-picking operation at another state's expense. In fact, 
Nevada froze its electric deregulation planning last year, pausing to 
reconsider its options, as a direct result of California's policy confusion. 
""We have delayed until we have a plan together where capacity exceeds (native 
in-state) demand,"" said Thomas. 

Sierra Pacific's power delivery capabilities are being enhanced by its plan 
to build a new 345-kV line in eastern Nevada to import power from Utah. In 
1998, it also installed a major line into the Pacific Northwest. Both 
developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to 
become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator. 

""We're learning our lesson here,"" said Thomas. Setting aside the issue of 
burgeoning energy demand requirements across the West, the need to recover 
stranded costs associated with deregulation is a preoccupation for power 
plant-owners in general, he said. 

As for California, "" I think the next couple of years are going to be some 
tight times, no doubt about it. And that's why what we're trying to do (in 
Nevada) is secure long-term contracts as well as short-term contracts to 
protect our customers while we're in the process of securing capacity, to 
ensure that we have an adequate supply of electricity at reasonable rates."" 

Other areas targeting California companies
It's not just Nevada's physical proximity to California that helps it attract 
relocating companies. It's also the different opportunities offered by 
Nevada's two main population centers, Reno and Las Vegas. Both cities attract 
different kinds of energy-dependent businesses from California. In this 
regard, ""We are two different markets,"" said Thomas.

In any case, Nevada isn't the only state that's getting calls, and returning 
interest in kind. Half a continent away, Tennessee's state department of 
economic and community development recently targeted about 1,000 California 
companies with financial enticements and advertisements that proclaim ""the 
lights are always on"" in the electric power-rich Tennessee Valley Authority's 
service territory. Elsewhere across the nation, from Seattle to Manhattan, 
there are initiatives to build or refurbish buildings to make them capable of 
servicing high-energy demand, Internet-related data centers. 

Nevada, however, has one giant advantage, aside from being closer to 
California. Las Vegas, for example, has one of the most extensive, readily 
accessible black fiber systems of any major metropolitan area in the United 
States. But of course it would. As the Nevada Development Authority's 
Hollingsworth joked: ""Most everything we have here is state-of-the-art and 
brand new because we blow everything up every 20 years. We just implode it 
and build something new."" The most recent casualty to fall to progress was 
the El Rancho Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, deemed past its prime, which bit 
the dust in October in a televised entertainment spectacle. Power to the 
people.

Kevin Hyatt and I attended Sempra Energy Trading's weather derivatives 
briefing in Houston last night, chaired by their chief meterologist, Dan 
Guertin.  Dan's forecast for the winter of '00-01 seems to track pretty much 
lockstep with the CPC's.  Dan also believes that this will be an 
""oceanographic neutral"" winter, with no El Nino or La Nina influences.  He 
sees slightly above average temperatures for the western marketplace and a 
relatively ""normal"" winter pattern (30 yr. avg.) for the mid-continent.

As far as monthly variations, he is predicting a cooler than usual November - 
December, and a slightly warmer than usual pattern for the remainder of the 
heating season.  He has promised to make his presentation information 
available to the briefing attendees.  If I can secure a copy of it, I'll pass 
it on.

Subject: CPC's Winter Weather Prediction for the U.S.

Climate Prediction Center Winter  Outlook
?
??? The Climate Prediction Center,  a unit of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, discusses the  outlook for this winter. The 
agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to  affect global weather for the 
next nine months. The two weather patterns, which  occur because of changes 
in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly  influence US rain 
patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will  be the first 
year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this  
particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a 
whole  lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have 
something to  do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have 
tended to make  temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that 
this winter  nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, 
but not as warm  as the last three. The northern part of the nation and 
particularly the  Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder 
weather. The warmer  pattern will be confined more to the West and the South. 
East of the Mississippi  with the exception of Florida should be cooler this 
winter and most of  California and the northern half of the Rockies and the 
Dakotas. For the fall  and winter, expect the Southwest to be the mild and 
dry.
